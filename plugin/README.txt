Wordpress News to Sender.net

A small plugin which will automatically create a Campaign in [Sender.net](https://www.sender.net) to a given group of subscribers.

== Description ==

This is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

A few notes about the sections above:

*  Your API key is validated upon save
*  You can customize the reply-to address and template used for the campaign
