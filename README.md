## Contributing

There's a packaged docker-compose configuration that will get this plugin up and running for you.  Once you're in the admin area you can "Activate" the plugin and start working with it.  To create a Campaign, you'll need a [Sender.net](https://www.sender.net) account with a verified domain name to test with.
